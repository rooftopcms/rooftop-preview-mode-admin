The rooftop-preview-mode-admin plugin add's the ability to preview content without publishing it
when Rooftop is properly configured and the client site is built with preview support.

Rooftop Preview Mode allows editors to preview their changes in your site, without having to publish the
changes live to Rooftop.

Once you have enabled & [configured](https://rooftopcms.readme.io/docs/preview-mode) Rooftop by adding a preview
mode endpoint, and implementing that endpoint in your site, your team will be able to preview their work by clicking
the 'Preview' button on the admin UI.

Otherwise you can install manually:

1. Upload the `rooftop-preview-mode-admin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. There is no step 3 :-)
